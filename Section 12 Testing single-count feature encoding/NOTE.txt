To validate that our multi-feature encoding approach is more appropriate for encoding signatures of CIN, we compared our approach to a single-count feature encoding inspired by an alternative method for obtaining copy number signatures.

#### Summary
1) Classification of each copy number segment into one of 28 categories based on copy number, segment length and genotype.
2) Run SigProfilerExtractor
3) Plot definitions of signatures deconstructed
