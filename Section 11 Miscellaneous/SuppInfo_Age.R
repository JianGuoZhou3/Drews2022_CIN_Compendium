#### Do it like Alexandrov et al. did in the recent PCAWG Mutational Signature paper 
### Step 1: Data cleaning
## "Before evaluating the association between age and the activity of a mutational signature, 
## all outliers for both age and numbers of mutations attributed to a signature in a cancer type 
## were removed from the data. An outlier was defined as any value outside three standard 
## deviations from the mean value."

### Step 2: Robust linear regression for each cancer type and signature
## "A robust linear regression model that estimated the slope of the line and whether this 
## slope was significantly different from zero (F test; P value < 0.05) was performed using 
## the MATLAB function robustfit (https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/robustfit.html) with 
## default parameters. The P values from the F tests were corrected using the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg 
## procedure for false discovery rates. Results are available at syn12030687 and syn20317940."

## Prepare
# meta => Cancer type
# clin => Age 
# cnas => Number of attributed CNAs
meta$Age = as.numeric(clin$Age[ match(meta$name, clin$Name) ])
metaFilt = meta[ meta$dCIN,]
# Remove samples with no age (NA) => 116 samples
metaFilt = metaFilt[ ! is.na(metaFilt$Age), ]
# Transfer estimated number of CNAs for CX1
metaFilt$AttrCNAs = cnas[ match(metaFilt$name, rownames(cnas)),"CX1"]


### Filter cancer types
## Because CNAs need time and lots of samples, we take only those from Gerstung et al. (Nature, 2020),
## that took longer than 10 years to develop for 1x (see Figure 5B). 10 years for accumulation of 
## CNAs and 1x because that has the most direct link to age (see Figure 5A).
## Also we take cancers with more than 200 samples (random large number) to ensure we are powered
## enough. => 9 cancer types survive => 2 of those are significant

## Additional information on Alexandrov et al. method:
## 1) Age and SBS1 is surprisingly complicated. Alexandrov et al. (Nature, 2020) used two approaches to
## calculate signatures and exposures for PCAWG: Signature Analyzer (SA) and SigProfiler (SP). Both
## approaches yield different significant results with cancer types:
## SP: Breast, Medullo, PiloAstro, Lymph-BNHL, Ovary, Thy-Adenoca => 6
## SA: Breast, Medullo, PiloAsto, Lymph-BNHL, Ovary, Thy-Adenoca (THCA), GBM, Oligo, Colorect, 
## Cervix (CESC), Kidney, Panc-Adenoca, Panc-Endocrine, Prost, Skin => 15
## Names PCAWG: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1969-6/tables/1
## 
## 2) SBS1 and CX1 is also quite diverse:
## Only cancer-specific significant correlation is BRCA. Other, non-significant but mostly
## around the BRCA correlation strength are STAD (stomach), READ (rectal), HNSC (head), SARC, BLCA.
## Some like SKCM (skin) or kidneys have strong negative correlations but not significant.
## OV has medium strong positive and LUSC almost zero correlation with SBS1.
## Only overlap to SP is BRCA.
## 
## 3) Age is extremely tricky. Only OV and LUSC are significant. UCEC is towards significance.
## BRCA is strongly negative but not significant. THCA, CESC, Kidneys, COAD, ESCA, PRAD have all
## negative slopes.
## UVM, THCA, CESC and LIHC (all the ones with strong negative slopes) are known to have distinct 
## and recurrent chromosomal imbalances.
